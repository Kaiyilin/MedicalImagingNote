# Basic concept of Biomedical Image Processing

## DICOM
Go check the [DICOMNote](./DICOMLearning/DICOMNote.md) for the details

## Concept of image processing
### 4 steps
<ol>
<li> Image Formation </li>
    All that helps forming a digital image matrix

<li> Image Visualisation </li>
    All types of manipulation of this matrix, resulting in an optimized output of the image.

<li> Image Analysis </li>
    All the steps of processing, which are used for quantitative measurements as well as abstract interpretations of biomedical images. Priori knowledge required
<li> Image Management </li>
    Efficient storage, communication, transmission, archiving, and access (retrieval) of image data.
</ol>

## Image Formation
### X-ray
Not important
### CT
Go check the [CTReconstructionNote.md](./CTReconstructionLearning/CTReconstructionNote.md) to see the code implementations
### MRI
Go check the [MRIReconstructionNote.md](./MRIReconstructionLearning/MRIReconstructionNote.md) to see the code implementations
### UltraSound
Not important

## Digitalisation
discrete nature of the images.
### 2 Concepts
#### Quantization
digitization of the value range.
#### Sampling 
Sampling refers to the digitization of the definition range. <br>
Remember the [**Nyquist theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem)?
